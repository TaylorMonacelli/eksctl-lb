# eksctl-lb

Demo of the AWS Load Balancer Controller deployed in a Kubernetes
cluster created with eksctl

> Note: This is not production-ready setup. It only demonstrates how
  to deploy the AWS Load Balancer controller and create NLB via
  Service and ALB via Ingress.

## Required tools
1. `eksctl` version `0.38.0` - [Install instructions](https://eksctl.io/introduction/#installation)
2. `kubectl` version `v1.18.0` - [Install instructions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
3. `helm` version `v3.2.0` - [Install instructions](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)


## How to deploy

1. Create the EKS cluster. After the cluster is created, the eksctl
cli will add the cluster config in the default kubeconfig location and
change the current kube context to the newly created one.
    ```bash
    ./scripts/create-eks-cluster.sh
    ```

2. Deploy the AWS Load Balancer Controller

    ```bash
    ./scripts/deploy-aws-lb-controller.sh
    ```

3. Deploy the NLB example. The script will print the NLB url in the
terminal. Note that it can take a few minutes until the load balancer
is ready.

    ```bash
    ./scripts/deploy-nlb-example.sh
    ```

4. Deploy the ALB example. The script will print the ALB url in the
terminal. Note that it can take a few minutes until the load balancer
is ready.

    ```bash
    ./scripts/deploy-alb-example.sh
    ```

## Cleanup
1. Delete all examples and the entire Kubernetes cluster
    ```bash
    ./scripts/cleanup.sh
    ```
